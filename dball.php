                  <p>This is an arcade game developed using processing. Its for two players and its based on dodge ball.The objective of the game is to shot the opponent and the first one to do this 3 times, wins!</p>
                  <p>Later this project was adapted to experiment with Arduino. Using two sensors the players had to physically throw a ball in a target in order for the players in the game to throw the ball and hit the opponent. </p>
                  <p>Try out the original game* and see the experimentation video.</p>
