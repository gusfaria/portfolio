                  <p>The challenge on this project was to create a website introducing the first campsite inside Parque Nacional de Itaiaia, Brazil's oldest national park, and one of its most ruggedly beautiful. Its rich, dark foliage contains more than 400 species of native birds and is also home to monkeys and sloths.</p>
                  <p>The campsite is located inside the grounds of a lodge with the same name, Aldeia dos Pássaros. The owner's objective was to develop the website using the same logo created for the lodging, however he wanted a simpler design as the type of guests were different.</p>
                  <p>The website's design try to make good use of the beautiful pictures, by using a dark clean background, also used to create contrast with the logo. Colors were used to match the menu and the logo, together with each different tend on the footer of each page.</p>
