                  <p>The intention of this project was to create the concept and the visual identity for an academic magazine. Its main objectives were to share design projects developed my design undergrad school with the rest of my college community, to help the design department to communicate with their students, and to work as a tool for the students to learn more about specific topic on design.</p>
                  <p>After working on the magazines' concept and defining each section, I chose its name as DEFAULT, and started working on its graphic design, by creating the logo and graphic elements. I have also work on the layout of some sections, however; unfortunately, the magazine couldn't be printed, because of a financial issue and lack of the school support.</p>
                  <p>The magazine's visual identity evolved around the pixel shaped created by the E and F empty spaces. It was used traditional typography such as impact for the logo. Also, the art direction of the magazine had the main objective to highlight not only the project, but also the artist/designer himself.</p>
                  <p>*The entirely content shown in the magazine is fictitious.</p>
