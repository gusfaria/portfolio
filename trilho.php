					Sensorial track was made in collaboration with the designer Twyla Mattos and the most important institute in Brazil for visual impaired, Instituto Benjamin Constant (IBC). The main objective of this project was to develop a product that would help visually impaired children (between 0 and 4) to practice their notions of space and direction, as well as, introduce different textures to enhance their touch sensibility.

					The result was 2 MDF boards that could be used to create tracks with different sets of textures and highly contrasted colors (for kids that were partially sighted). Sandpaper, sponge, foam and cotton were some of the initial options for the tracks. The biggest challenge was to create a low cost product that could be simple to be reproduced and easy to create new possibilities, new textures.
