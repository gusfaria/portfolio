                  <p>While watching a movie a person can have different reactions towards one scene or another. When we watch an intense scene our heart rate and blood pressure increases. This increase can vary from one person to another, depending on the intensity of how the scene affects the viewer.</p>
                  <p>Taking this into consideration, Audience Choice is a website that together with an Arduino and a Pulse sensor drives you from one scene to another depending on the viewer’s heart rate. Thus, leaving the viewer’s heart to drive the narrative of the story.</p>
                  <p>The scenes were curated in a way to explore as many genre as possible.</p>
