                  <p>This is a game making use of Kyle McDonald's ofxFacetracking. Conceptually, it's a critic on fastfood diet, making fun of our desire and pleasure in fast food and it's consequences. </p>
                  <p>The objective of the game is to eat as much mini pizzas and burgers as you can, in a time limit of 1 minute. Pizzas are worth 1 point and burgers are worth 5 points. However, the more you eat ... the more you get fat and your mobility around the screen can get  pretty hard. Also, the player must open their mouths to eat the food. Chewing is essential!</p>
